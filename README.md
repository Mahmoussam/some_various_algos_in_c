# some_sorting_algos_in_c
It is just an implementation of some sorting algos in C as an exercise :D
I am working on this with my friend Mahmoud AlAzhary!
## Quicksort Lomuto partition
  Big-O notation time complexity:
  - Best = Average = O(n log(n))
  - Worst = O(nÂ²)
## BFS shortest path finder
  Time complexity of O(n*m)
  [+] Maybe extended it to a 2D graphical game with sockets to have 2 players...
